### Installing:
```R
library("devtools")
install_github("primitybio/cellengine-r-toolkit")
```

### First steps

#### Authentication

For interactive sessions, calling `authenticate()` will prompt you for your
login info:

```R
library("cellengine")
authenticate() # prompts for username and password (and OTP if configured)
authenticate("username") # prompts for password (and OTP if configured)
```

For non-interactive sessions, we recommend avoiding saving your password in
plaintext because it's not secure. Consider instead using an environment
variable or `.Renviron`.
```R
library("cellengine")
authenticate("username", Sys.getenv("CELLENGINE_PASSWORD"))
```

#### Get experiments

You can list all experiments that you have access to:
```R
experiments = getExperiments()
```

Or fetch individual experiments by ID or name:

```R
exp2 = getExperiment("57c4d7d4e69a1e890c4d8d2f")
exp3 = getExperiment(byName("experiment_name"))
```

### Looking up Resources by Name:

Gates, Populations, FcsFiles, and Compensations can all be requested by name.
If you are looking up a resource from a specific experiment, this must be done
with the `byName` function:
```R
experimentId = "57c4d7d4e69a1e890c4d8d2f"
gate = getGate(expermentId, byName("gate_name"))
```

Looking up a resource by name requires one extra API call and thus is slightly
slower than using a resource by ID. However, by-name lookups are cached for the
duration of the R session, so repeated by-name lookups of the same object are
just as fast as a request by ID.

You can also create a per-Experiment lookup object, which can be used to find
resources by name or ID. This makes it convenient to query different types of
resources from a single experiment:
```R
experimentId = "57c4d7d4e69a1e890c4d8d2f"
lookup = createLookup(experimentId)
gate = lookup("gates", "gate_name")
population = lookup("populations", "population_name")
```
