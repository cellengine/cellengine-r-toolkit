title: "Subtracting Histograms"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
---

The function below subtracts two histograms to calculate an estimated "percent
positive." Four estimation methods are provided:

* `"channel-by-channel"` is as described in [Overton 1988](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3061754/)
  and simply subtracts the two histograms, bin-by-bin, then sets negative
  differences to zero. (Histogram bins were historically called "channels" on
  old, analog cytometers.)

* `"Overton"` is as described in [Overton 1989](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/cyto.990100421)
  and is like "channel-by-channel," except negative values are subtracted from
  other bins instead of set to zero.

* `"ENS"` is the "enhanced normalized subtraction method" described in
  https://www.vsh.com/publication/JourneyThroughImmunofluorescenceAnalysis.pdf.
  In some places, this is also referred to as the "super-enhanced D value,"
  "SED" or "SEDymax," although there is another unpublished definition for
  "SED" that is different from "ENS." See also https://www.vsh.com/Publication/SuperEnhancedDValue.pdf.
  This method does not support `showPlot=TRUE`.

* `"KS"` is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test D-value. Its value is the same as
  `"Overton"` but it does not support `showPlot=TRUE`.

Below is an example histogram and the percent positive calculated by each
method:

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="histosub1.png" style="max-width: unset;" />

  | Method | Estimate |
  | ------ | -------: |
  | ENS | 83.7%
  | channel-by-channel | 66.8%
  | Overton | 66.1%
  | KS | 66.2%

```R
#' Performs subtraction of two histograms to calculate percent positive.
#'
#' @param experimentId ID of experiment or a [`byName`] expression.
#' @param channel The channel name, like "PE-A" (not the reagent name like
#'   "CD3").
#' @param population The population ID or a [`byName`] expression.
#' @param file1 ID or `byName` expression of the file to subtract from (the test
#'   or sample file).
#' @param file2 ID of `byName` expression of the file to subtract (the control
#'   file).
#' @param method One of `"channel-by-channel"`, `"Overton"`, `"ENS"` or `"KS"`.
#' @param bins The number of histogram bins/channels. (Not applicable to `"KS"`
#'   method.)
#' @param showPlot If `TRUE`, displays a barplot of the subtracted histograms.
