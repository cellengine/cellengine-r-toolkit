### Converting flowDensity gates:
[flowDensity](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowDensity.html)
gates can be converted to CellEngine gates. The class of a flowDensity gate is
`"CellPopulation"`. The `flowDensity@filter` is always a polygon, so
`cellengine::createPolygonGate` can be used for this purpose:

```R
file = "sample1.fcs"
flowDensityGate <- flowDensity::flowDensity(file, params)@filter
experimentId <- "5d2f8b4b21fd0676fb3a6a8c"

polyGate <- createPolygonGate(
    experimentId,
    colnames(flowDensityGate)[1],
    colnames(flowDensityGate)[2],
    name,
    vertices = list(flowDensityGate),
)
```

As a function:
```R
convertFlowDensity <- function(flowDensityOutput, experimentId, name = NULL, ...) {
  flowDensityGate <- flowDensityOutput@filter
  createPolygonGate(
    experimentId,
    colnames(flowDensityGate)[1],
    colnames(flowDensityGate)[2],
    name,
    vertices = list(flowDensityGate),
    ...
  )
}
```
