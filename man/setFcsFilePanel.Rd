\description{
Updates the panel properties of an FCS file.
}
\details{
A panel must be specified as a list of lists. Each inner list must have at
least \code{channel} and \code{index} properties, and may optionally have a
\code{reagent} property.

The \code{index} value corresponds to the parameter index (i.e. the n in
"$PnN" from the FCS file header). This property allows the list of channels
to be in any order.

The \code{channel} value corresponds to the channel name. Channel names are
used for matching channels between FCS files, gates, scales and compensations.

The \code{reagent} value is used for various displays, including plot axis
labels, and is typically the reagent description (e.g. "CD3-PacBlu").

The \code{panelName} property is used to group files by panel.
